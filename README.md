# RaptVR
### A small and tranquil webVR app

## How To Use
* Clone the repo onto your local environment on your desktop.
* Run npm install
* When installation is finished, run webpack-dev-server --open.
* The app should automatically open on your localhost in the browser.
* In another tab, run webpack -p so that it keeps track of changes in your dist folder.
* If you'd like to view it on your phone for use with google cardboard, [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is a useful tool for tunneling your localhost into a url.

* A-Frame
* Three.js
